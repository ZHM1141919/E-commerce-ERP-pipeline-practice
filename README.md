# E-commerce-ERP-pipeline-practice
This project simulates a real-world ERP workflow, building a full-stack data pipeline from raw ingestion to business intelligence. It replicates professional business logic through a lightweight, high-performance tech stack.
Data Sourcing: Utilized Kaggle e-commerce datasets to ensure data authenticity and compliance.
ETL & Integration (SQL): Conducted deep data cleansing, schema standardization, and multi-dimensional table joins. Leveraged Python’s built-in SQLite engine for core ETL processes, including data cleansing, schema standardization, and complex table joins.
Preprocessing (Python): Applied advanced data manipulation and feature preparation for business-oriented analysis.
Visualization (Looker Studio): Engineered interactive dashboards to track core KPIs and drive strategic decision-making.

E-commerce Fulfillment Analysis
1. The Problem: What's Killing Customer Satisfaction?
In e-commerce, a late delivery isn't just a shipping issue—it's a cross-departmental failure. This project identifies the "bottleneck" that triggers negative reviews.
2. Core Analytical Framework:
I deconstruct the total delivery time into two critical phases to pinpoint responsibility:
Internal Efficiency: How long it takes the seller to pack and hand over the order.
External Logistics: how long the carrier takes to transport the goods to the customer.
3. Strategic Goals :
Root Cause Analysis: Is the delay caused by "slow packing" (Seller issue) or "slow transit" (Logistics issue)?
Geographic Optimization: Identifying the Top "High-Latency Regions" to decide whether to invest in local warehouses or switch logistics providers.
ROI of Speed: Quantifying exactly how much a delivery delay drops a customer's review score, proving the financial value of faster fulfillment.
